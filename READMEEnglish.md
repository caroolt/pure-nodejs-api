### Project Description
###### description
Before learning express and other frameworks that facilitate the creation of API's it is necessary and interesting to understand how it works behind the scenes with javascript. In this repository, I made an API that takes a list of mocked users and performs the methods: 
GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

Without the use of any framework.
